# AI-Generated-Text-Detection
The rise of AI-generated text presents significant challenges in distinguishing human-written text from AI-generated text. We use machine learning algorithm to address this challenge. By employing a combination of BERT-based feature extraction and an XGBoost classifier, the system achieves high accuracy in differentiating between the two types of text. The model ensures consistent performance across various contexts. The trained model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a 97.7% accuracy rate in classification. This work contributes to the fields of AI ethics and content security by providing a reliable tool to detect AI-generated text, reducing risks across academia, journalism, and social media.
